# Overview
Provide a solution where users in an organization can manage their own Azure AD App Registrations, and can get notified of upcoming secret and certificate expiries. This will help alleviate the load on operations staff who may perform these functions on behalf of users within an organization, particularly where the Azure AD "Application developer" role is not used.
